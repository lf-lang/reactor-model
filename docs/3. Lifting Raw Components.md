# Lifting Raw Components

## `Change`

### Raw Lifting

Before we move on, we need to consider one detail of the `create` constructor.
While `Raw.Change` takes a `Raw.Reactor` as parameter for its `create` constructor, we now take a "proper"
`Reactor`. This detail will become relevant when transforming `Raw.Reaction`s to "proper" `Reaction`s
(in [`Reaction` (and Mutations)](#reaction-and-mutations)), because it will require us to turn `Raw.Change`s into "proper" `Change`s.
For this purpose we define a `Change.fromRaw` function:

```lean
def Change.fromRaw
  {rtr : Raw.Reactor ι υ} (hw : rtr.wellFormed) 
  {rcn : Raw.Reaction ι υ} (hr : ∃ i, rtr.rcns i = rcn) 
  {raw : Raw.Change ι υ} {p s} (hc : raw ∈ Raw.Reaction.body rcn p s) : 
  Change ι υ :=
  match hm:raw with 
    | Raw.Change.port target value  => Change.port target value  
    | Raw.Change.state target value => Change.state target value 
    | Raw.Change.connect src dst    => Change.connect src dst    
    | Raw.Change.disconnect src dst => Change.disconnect src dst 
    | Raw.Change.delete rtrID       => Change.delete rtrID
    | Raw.Change.create cr id => 
      let cr' := Reactor.fromRaw (by
          rw [hm] at hc
          have ha := Raw.Reactor.isAncestorOf.creatable hr.choose_spec hc
          exact Raw.Reactor.isAncestorOf_preserves_wf ha hw
      )
      Change.create cr' id
```

Turning a `Raw.Change` into a `Change` is trivial for all constructors except the `create` constructor, where we
need to turn a `Raw.Reactor` into a `Reactor`. This is only possible if the raw reactor is well-formed, which is 
why the `Change.fromRaw` function requires a host of preconditions which allow us to prove this fact.

### Raw Equivalence

In the following sections, we will come across more functions like `Change.fromRaw`, where we perform lifting of
raw components. To ensure that we perform this lifting properly, we prove that the lifted component is in fact
"equivalent" to the raw component from which it was lifted.
The precise definition of equivalence is different for each component, but it generally comes down to showing that
the "proper" and the raw instances contain the same data. Since our definitions of "proper" components are generally
the same as the raw components, just with additional proofs added on top, this comparison of "same data" is very direct.

The relation that expresses equivalence between a `Change` and a `Raw.Change` looks as follows:

```lean
inductive Change.rawEquiv (c : Change ι υ) (raw : Raw.Change ι υ) : Prop
  | port       {t v} :    (c = Change.port t v)       → (raw = Raw.Change.port t v)                         → rawEquiv c raw
  | state      {t v} :    (c = Change.state t v)      → (raw = Raw.Change.state t v)                        → rawEquiv c raw
  | connect    {s d} :    (c = Change.connect s d)    → (raw = Raw.Change.connect s d)                      → rawEquiv c raw
  | disconnect {s d} :    (c = Change.disconnect s d) → (raw = Raw.Change.disconnect s d)                   → rawEquiv c raw
  | create     {r r' i} : (c = Change.create r i)     → (raw = Raw.Change.create r' i)    → (r.rawEquiv r') → rawEquiv c raw
  | delete     {i}   :    (c = Change.delete i)       → (raw = Raw.Change.delete i)                         → rawEquiv c raw
```

The `rawEquiv` relation for changes only holds when both changes are built from "the same" constructor with the same data.
The `create` constructor is special again in that the "proper" constructor takes a `Reactor`, while the raw constructor takes a
`Raw.Reactor`. In this case we also need to require that those reactors are raw-equivalent. Luckily, raw-equivalence for
reactors is trivial:

```lean
def Reactor.rawEquiv (rtr : Reactor ι υ) (raw : Raw.Reactor ι υ) : Prop :=
  rtr.raw = raw
```

## `Reaction`

Lifting of `Raw.Reaction`s to `Reaction`s is performed in `Reaction.fromRaw`.
The main steps for lifting are converting `Raw.Changes` produced by the reactions body into "proper" `Change`s, and proving that
the constraint properties of `Reaction` hold for the lifted reaction:

```lean
def Reaction.fromRaw {rtr : Raw.Reactor ι υ} (hw : rtr.wellFormed) {raw : Raw.Reaction ι υ} (hr : ∃ i, rtr.rcns i = raw) : Reaction ι υ := {
  deps := raw.deps,
  triggers := raw.triggers,
  children := raw.children,
  body := (λ p s => (raw.body p s).attach.map (λ c => Change.fromRaw hw hr c.property)),
  tsSubInDeps := ...,
  outDepOnly := ...,
  normNoChild := ...
}
```

The notion of raw-equivalence for reactions is again almost trivial, except for `body`:

```lean
structure Reaction.rawEquiv (rcn : Reaction ι υ) (raw : Raw.Reaction ι υ) : Prop :=
  deps :     rcn.deps = raw.deps
  triggers : rcn.triggers = raw.triggers
  children : rcn.children = raw.children
  body :     ∀ p s, List.forall₂ Change.rawEquiv (rcn.body p s) (raw.body p s)
```

The `body` property states that on equal inputs `p` and `s`, the "proper" `rcn` and `raw` reaction both have to produce the "same"
outputs, in the sense that the produced changes all have to be raw-equivalent and in the same order (cf. `List.forall₂`).
