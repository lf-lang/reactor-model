#### 27.06.2021: 
Completed the formalization of timed execution along with corresponding documentation.
Execution now uses a `seq`-based and more descriptive approach than (and completely replaces) the one presented in [Provable Determinism in Reactors](https://github.com/marcusrossel/bachelors-thesis/blob/main/Thesis/Thesis.pdf) Section 5. The idea for this approach came as a result of reading Andr√©s' formalization of execution (in his dissertation). The thought process is roughly outlined in a previous version of `IDEAS.md`.
