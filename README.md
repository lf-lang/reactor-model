# Reactor Model

This repository contains a [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4)-based formalization of the _Reactor model_ - a model of computation underlying the [Lingua Franca](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca) language. 

## Resources

The paper [Provable Determinism for Software in Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/files/Images/people/chair-cc/publications/2310_Rossel_VSSTE.pdf) explains the formalization at a high level. While this formalization differs quite significantly from previous work, the following list contains relevant literature covering the Reactor model:
